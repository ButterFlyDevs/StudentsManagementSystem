##Contributing Guidelines

Do you want contribute in this project?  **Great !!! :)**

But before, we want that you know how do the things in this project to everyone follow the same way.


####Python

To write python we try to follow the *[PEP-8 Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)* as much as possible.

The mainly rules for us are:

* Function names: should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability. 

* Constants: are usually defined on a module level and written in all capital letters with underscores separating words. 
Examples include MAX_OVERFLOW and TOTAL.

* Class: names should normally use the CamelCase convention. 
 
* Maximum Line Length: Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.

* Package and Module Names: Modules should have short, all-lowercase 
names. Underscores can be used in the module name if it improves 
readability. Python packages should also have short, all-lowercase 
names, although the use of underscores is discouraged. 

* Comments: 
    * Inline Comments. Use inline comments sparingly. An inline comment is a comment on the same 
    line as a statement. Inline comments should be separated by at least two spaces from the statement. 
    They should start with a # and a single space.

    * Block comments generally apply to some (or all) code that follows them, and are indented to the same level as that code. 
    Each line of a block comment starts with a # and a single space (unless it is indented text inside the comment).Paragraphs inside a block comment are separated by a line containing a single #
     
* Documentation Strings. 
    * Conventions for writing good documentation are immortalized in PEP 257.  Note that most 
    importantly, the """ that ends a multiline docstring should be on a line by itself.
    * For one liner docstrings, please keep the closing """ on the same line. 


* Names to Avoid: Never use the characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 
'O' (uppercase letter oh), or 'I' (uppercase letter eye) as single 
character variable names. In some fonts, these characters are 
indistinguishable from the numerals one and zero. When tempted 
to use 'l', use 'L' instead.

More details in PEP-8 guide.

*Note:

If you use PyCharm like us is easy to achieve this thanks her code automatic corrector.

####JavaScript


Write mainly in [lowerCamelCase](http://wiki.c2.com/?LowerCamelCase) 

We try to follow the standard JSDoc to doc AngularJS code in JavaScript language that we develop.

####Issues, branchs, and new user stories or complete modules and microservices.


**About English**
 
 
* When writing English, follow Strunk and White. 
Python coders from non-English speaking countries: please write your 
omments in English, unless you are 120% sure that the code will never 
be read by people who don't speak your language. PEP-8.*

Final note:

It's only a lot of rules, but don't worry, relax and code,
we only do this for fun. :)
