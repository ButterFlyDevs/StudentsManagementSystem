##bower

We use a bower (is the most simple) to ensure that all people that work in this project have the same javascript libraries and to give a simple way to obtain this in local.

You only need to have installed bower and execute `bower install` in the same folder.

Some details:

Some instalations have dependencies, because of this when we install `"angular-material": "1.1.0"` for example we can see installed `angular`, `angular-animate`, `angular-aria`, `angular-material` and `angular-messages`.
